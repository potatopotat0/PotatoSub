Potato Sub is a app with handy graphical interface to burn subtitle files into video. It's built with the Electron framework.

The app is currently at its very early stage and improvements to the frontend UI and addtions to functions is expected (at some time). With that said, very basic functions like burnning subtitles into video is usable by now.
